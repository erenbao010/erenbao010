We need to create a dummy node then assign dummy node with tail node ( meaning node we will use with ListNode in this problem ) dummy Node will be used as a ListNode store final list .
We have to sorted list. So we gonna compare value list1 vs list2 which is smaller val of list.
We assign list to tail.next because ListNode() temp == null now. So tail.next = list meaning first value of list = first node in temp.
then assign list into tail ( ListNode() temp)
assign  next node of smaller val = current list of smaller value.
return temp.next instead of temp because temp.next contains every value of list in two sorted list. 
If we return only temp, it'll contains { 0,.....} Not exactly ListNode() we want to return.
