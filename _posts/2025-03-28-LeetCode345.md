reverseVowels
You will create a String with vowels include of Uppercase
Then you create a list of char to extract every character of List String input
So you create two pointer, one with start = start index, and the other one will be length of input -1
While loop
compare till vowels.indexOf(character != vowels)
IndexOf will return
An int value, representing the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string, or -1 if it never occurs
if it meets condition of IndexOf ( meaning can not find character is vowel still yet)
start++,
and the pointer end will --
then will swap two character with temp variable
return String list

You can remember what this solution do under the hook ! Exactly
